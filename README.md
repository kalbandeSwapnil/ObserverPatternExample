# ObserverPatternExample

# Observer Pattern :
-Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

-Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.

-The observer pattern is used when the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object without keeping the objects tight coupled.

This is very simple example of Observer Pattern.
